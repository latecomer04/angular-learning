<!-- Here will see how to bind the data in ts file with the html files -->
<!-- how interpolation works -> write down the variable name in curly braces  -->
<h1>Welcome to {{hotelName}}</h1>


<!-- you can also bind any variable to any valid property of a html tag -->
 <div [hidden]="hideRooms">
    <h2>The no. of rooms</h2>
    <div [innerText]="noOfRooms"></div> 
 </div>
 
 <!-- but always remember the property should be valid for that html tag. -->

<!-- Third way to bind the data in ts file with html file is using event binding .
    so whenever that event will occur , the specified piece of code will be executed.
-->
<!-- syntax => in round brackets specify the event 
    (click)="function_name()"
-->
<button (click)="toggle()">Hide Rooms</button>

<!-- so these were the 3 ways of transfering data from html to ts files or vice versa
    1-> interpolation {{var name }} 2-> property binding [valid html prop] syntax 
    3-> event binding (event_name) syntax
